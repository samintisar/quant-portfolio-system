# Trading Strategy Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Trading strategy description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse trading strategy description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No strategy description provided"
2. Extract key trading concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: assets, timeframes, indicators, risk rules
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill Trading Scenarios & Backtesting section
   ‚Üí If no clear trading logic: ERROR "Cannot determine trading scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable via backtesting
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Trading Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Strategy has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (strategy ready for implementation planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT trading strategy does and WHY it should generate alpha
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no algorithms, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for quantitative analysts, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every trading strategy
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the strategy
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this strategy spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "momentum strategy" without timeframe), mark it
3. **Think like a quant**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Asset classes and instruments
   - Timeframes and holding periods
   - Risk parameters and position sizing
   - Entry/exit criteria
   - Market regime considerations
   - Performance benchmarks and targets

## Trading Scenarios & Backtesting *(mandatory)*

### Primary Trading Strategy
[Describe the main trading logic in quantitative terms]

### Market Regime Analysis
1. **Bull Market**: [How strategy performs in upward trending markets]
2. **Bear Market**: [How strategy performs in downward trending markets]
3. **Sideways Market**: [How strategy performs in range-bound markets]
4. **High Volatility**: [How strategy handles volatile conditions]

### Backtest Scenarios
- **Given** [market conditions], **When** [signal triggers], **Then** [expected trade action]
- **Given** [market conditions], **When** [risk limit breached], **Then** [expected risk response]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Strategy MUST [specific capability, e.g., "detect momentum signals using moving average crossover"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "calculate position size based on volatility"]
- **FR-003**: Strategy MUST be able to [key trading action, e.g., "enter long positions when RSI < 30"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "maintain historical price data for 252 days"]
- **FR-005**: Strategy MUST [risk management, e.g., "implement stop-loss at 2% below entry"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: Strategy MUST trade [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: asset class not specified - equities, forex, commodities?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST achieve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance target not specified - Sharpe ratio, CAGR, max drawdown?]

### Key Trading Entities *(include if strategy involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

### Risk Parameters *(mandatory for trading strategies)*
- **Maximum Position Size**: [e.g., 5% of portfolio or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- **Stop Loss**: [e.g., 2% below entry or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- **Take Profit**: [e.g., 3% above entry or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- **Maximum Drawdown**: [e.g., 10% from peak or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
