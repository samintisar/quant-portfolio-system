# Quantitative Trading System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First Architecture
Every feature starts as a standalone, testable library with clear mathematical purpose. Libraries must be:
- Self-contained with minimal dependencies
- Independently testable with statistical validation
- Well-documented with mathematical formulations
- Domain-focused: data ingestion, modeling, optimization, risk, backtesting

### II. CLI Interface & Reproducibility
Every library exposes functionality via CLI for reproducible research:
- Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr
- Support JSON + human-readable formats for parameter configs
- All model runs must be reproducible with seed control
- Configuration files must be version-controlled

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory with emphasis on statistical validation:
- Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement
- Unit tests for mathematical correctness
- Statistical tests for model performance (backtests, Monte Carlo)
- Integration tests for data pipeline integrity

### IV. Data Quality & Validation
Rigorous data validation at every stage:
- Input data validation (missing values, outliers, consistency)
- Model output validation (statistical properties, bounds checking)
- Pipeline integrity tests (end-to-end data flow)
- Performance monitoring (execution time, memory usage)

### V. Risk Management & Observability
Comprehensive logging and risk controls:
- Structured logging for all model decisions and portfolio changes
- Risk metrics calculation and monitoring (VaR, drawdown, exposure)
- Performance attribution tracking
- Alert systems for constraint violations

### VI. Versioning & Model Governance
Strict versioning for model reproducibility:
- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format for all libraries
- Model versioning with parameter snapshots
- Backward compatibility for historical analysis
- Documentation of all model changes and rationale

### VII. Simplicity & Financial Soundness
Start simple, validate thoroughly before adding complexity:
- Implement basic models before advanced techniques
- Validate against established benchmarks (S&P 500, risk-free rate)
- No premature optimization - measure performance bottlenecks first
- Maximum 3 libraries per feature initially

## Financial Constraints

### Performance Standards
- Target Sharpe ratio > 1.5 for optimized portfolios
- Maximum drawdown < 15% under normal market conditions
- Benchmark outperformance > 200 bps annually
- Portfolio rebalancing frequency: weekly maximum

### Risk Limits
- Single name concentration < 5% of portfolio
- Sector concentration < 20% of portfolio
- Leverage ratio < 1.5x for long-only strategies
- VaR at 95% confidence < 2% daily portfolio value

### Data Requirements
- Minimum 10 years historical data for backtesting
- Daily data frequency minimum (intraday preferred)
- Coverage of 500+ liquid instruments
- Historical data quality validation required

## Development Workflow

### Model Development Process
1. Literature review and theoretical foundation
2. Data exploration and feature engineering
3. Model implementation with statistical tests
4. Backtesting with out-of-sample validation
5. Risk assessment and constraint verification
6. Performance attribution analysis

### Code Review Requirements
- Mathematical correctness verification
- Statistical test coverage > 80%
- Backtest results validation
- Risk metrics calculation review
- Performance benchmark comparison

### Research Validation Gates
- All statistical tests passing
- Backtest performance meets targets
- Risk constraints validated
- Documentation complete with mathematical formulations

## Governance

### Constitution Authority
This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All features must:
- Pass constitutional compliance checks
- Justify any complexity deviations
- Use CLAUDE.md for runtime development guidance
- Validate against financial soundness principles

### Amendment Process
Model and constitution changes require:
- Statistical evidence supporting the change
- Risk impact assessment
- Backward compatibility analysis
- Documentation of rationale and alternatives considered
