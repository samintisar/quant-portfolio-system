# Tasks: Portfolio Optimization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-description-portfolio-optimization/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Python 3.11+, Pandas/NumPy/CVXPY, single project structure
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 6 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: 1 file → 3 contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract tech decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract 3 usage scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, configuration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: data models, optimization methods, API layer
   → Integration: data service, performance calculations
   → Polish: unit tests, documentation, examples
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All 3 API endpoints have tests?
   → All 6 entities have models?
   → All 3 optimization methods implemented?
```
