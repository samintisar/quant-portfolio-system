# Feature Specification: Portfolio Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `[001-description-portfolio-optimization]`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Portfolio Optimization (001)\n**Spec**: `specs/001-portfolio-optimization/spec.md`\n- Mean-Variance, Black-Litterman, CVaR optimization\n- Basic risk constraints and performance metrics\n- Simple validation approach"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a quantitative portfolio manager, I need to optimize investment portfolios using multiple mathematical approaches (Mean-Variance, Black-Litterman, CVaR) so that I can maximize returns while managing risk according to specific constraints and performance metrics.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a set of financial assets with historical return data, **When** I apply Mean-Variance optimization, **Then** the system must generate an optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes the Sharpe ratio
2. **Given** market views and confidence levels, **When** I apply Black-Litterman optimization, **Then** the system must incorporate these views into the portfolio weights while respecting the confidence levels
3. **Given** risk constraints and loss tolerance levels, **When** I apply CVaR optimization, **Then** the system must minimize the expected shortfall beyond the Value at Risk threshold
4. **Given** basic risk constraints (e.g., maximum position size, sector limits), **When** I run any optimization method, **Then** the resulting portfolio must respect all specified constraints
5. **Given** an optimized portfolio, **When** I request performance metrics, **Then** the system must calculate and display key metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and benchmark comparison

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there's insufficient historical data for optimization?
- How does the system handle assets with highly correlated returns?
- What occurs when risk constraints are mathematically impossible to satisfy simultaneously?
- How does the system handle assets with missing or zero variance data?
- What happens when market views in Black-Litterman are contradictory?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement Mean-Variance optimization that maximizes risk-adjusted returns
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement Black-Litterman optimization that incorporates investor views with confidence levels
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement CVaR optimization that minimizes expected shortfall beyond specified VaR threshold
- **FR-004**: System MUST support basic risk constraints including position limits, sector concentration limits, and maximum drawdown limits
- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate and display performance metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and benchmark comparison
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate input data quality before optimization runs
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what type of output format? Excel, CSV, JSON, or all?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what time periods for optimization? Daily, weekly, monthly?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Portfolio**: Collection of financial assets with specific weights representing the optimized allocation
- **Asset**: Individual financial instrument with historical return data, risk characteristics, and metadata
- **Risk Constraint**: Limits and boundaries applied to portfolio construction (position size, sector exposure, drawdown limits)
- **Performance Metric**: Quantitative measures of portfolio performance (Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, benchmark comparison)
- **Market View**: Investor's expectations about asset returns with confidence levels for Black-Litterman optimization
