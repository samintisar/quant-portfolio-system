# Feature Specification: Core Forecasting Models for Returns & Volatility

**Feature Branch**: `003-goal-implement-core`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Goal: Implement core forecasting models for returns & volatility: - ARIMA/GARCH for return and volatility time series. - Hidden Markov Models for regime detection (bull/bear/volatile). - Belief networks for scenario modeling (e.g., recession vs. growth). - Sanity-check signals in exploratory notebooks. Deliverable: Signals and forecasts saved per asset with regime labels."

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "optimization strategy" without risk constraints), mark it
3. **Think like a quant researcher**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas in quantitative finance**:
   - Mathematical formulations and model assumptions
   - Risk constraints and performance targets (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
   - Data requirements (frequency, history, universe coverage)
   - Backtesting methodology and validation approaches
   - Statistical significance thresholds and confidence levels
   - Portfolio construction constraints (concentration, leverage, turnover)
   - Benchmark definitions and performance attribution
   - Model governance and version control requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a quantitative researcher, I need to generate reliable forecasts for asset returns and volatility using multiple statistical models, detect market regimes to understand changing conditions, model different economic scenarios, and validate signal quality through exploratory analysis so that I can make informed investment decisions based on statistically sound predictions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** historical price data for a set of financial assets, **When** I run ARIMA models on return time series, **Then** the system generates return forecasts with confidence intervals for each asset
2. **Given** historical return data, **When** I run GARCH models on volatility time series, **Then** the system produces volatility forecasts and risk metrics for each asset
3. **Given** multivariate market data, **When** I apply Hidden Markov Models, **Then** the system identifies market regimes (bull/bear/volatile) and assigns regime labels to time periods
4. **Given** economic indicators and market data, **When** I build belief networks, **Then** the system models scenarios (recession vs. growth) and their impact on asset returns
5. **Given** generated forecasts and signals, **When** I perform sanity checks in notebooks, **Then** the system provides validation metrics and quality assessments for all predictions
6. **Given** all model outputs, **When** I save the results, **Then** the system stores signals and forecasts per asset with regime labels in a structured format

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there is insufficient historical data for model training?
- How does the system handle assets with limited trading history or irregular price patterns?
- What occurs during market regime transitions when model uncertainty is highest?
- How does the system respond to extreme market events (black swans) that break normal assumptions?
- What happens when economic indicators conflict during scenario modeling?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate time series forecasts for asset returns using ARIMA models with configurable parameters
- **FR-002**: System MUST produce volatility forecasts using GARCH family models with different distributional assumptions
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect and classify market regimes using Hidden Markov Models with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: optimal number of regimes?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST model economic scenarios using belief networks that capture relationships between economic indicators and asset returns
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide sanity-check mechanisms for signal quality in exploratory notebooks
- **FR-006**: System MUST save all forecasts and signals per asset with corresponding regime labels
- **FR-007**: System MUST calculate statistical significance and confidence intervals for all forecasts
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle multiple asset classes with different data characteristics
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate model assumptions and provide warnings when violations occur
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate regime transition probabilities and persistence metrics

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Asset Return Forecast**: Predicted future returns for individual assets with confidence intervals, generated from ARIMA models
- **Volatility Forecast**: Predicted future volatility patterns and risk metrics, generated from GARCH models
- **Market Regime**: Classified market state (bull/bear/volatile) with transition probabilities and persistence characteristics
- **Economic Scenario**: Modeled economic condition (recession/growth) with probabilistic impacts on asset returns
- **Signal Validation**: Quality assessment metrics for all forecasts including statistical significance and model fit indicators
- **Asset Regime Label**: Combined asset-level classification incorporating return forecasts, volatility expectations, and market regime
