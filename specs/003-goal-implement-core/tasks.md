# Tasks: Core Forecasting Models for Returns & Volatility

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-goal-implement-core/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Critical Success Factors
- **TDD Compliance**: All tests in T004-T011 must fail before any implementation

   - Each enhancement → unit test for correctness [P]
   - Heavy-tail considerations → specialized validation tests

2. **From Enhanced Data Requirements**:
   - Economic data lags → specialized data quality tests [P]
   - Extreme events → anomaly detection tests [P]
   - Each enhanced entity → model creation task [P]

3. **From Advanced Risk Requirements**:
   - Regime-aware risk metrics → enhanced calculation tests [P]

   - Extreme events → stress testing validation tasks

4. **From Enhanced Financial Requirements**:
   - ML baselines → benchmark comparison tasks
   - Regime-switching models → specialized backtest scenarios
