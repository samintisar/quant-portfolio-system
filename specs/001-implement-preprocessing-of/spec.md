# Feature Specification: Data Preprocessing System

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-preprocessing-of`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement preprocessing of the data: cleaning, missing values, normalization etc."

---

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a quantitative researcher, I need to preprocess financial market data to ensure data quality and consistency before performing analysis, building models, or executing trading strategies. The preprocessing should handle common data issues like missing values, outliers, and inconsistent scales that could lead to inaccurate results or biased trading decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a dataset with missing price values, **When** I apply the preprocessing pipeline, **Then** the system should fill or remove missing values according to configured rules
2. **Given** a dataset with extreme outliers, **When** I apply outlier detection, **Then** the system should identify and handle outliers based on statistical thresholds
3. **Given** multiple time series with different scales, **When** I apply normalization, **Then** all series should be scaled to comparable ranges
4. **Given** raw market data, **When** I run the preprocessing pipeline, **Then** the output should be clean, validated data ready for analysis

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all values in a time series are missing?
- How does the system handle data gaps longer than [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum acceptable gap duration]?
- What occurs when data contains impossible values (negative prices, zero volume)?
- How does the system handle different data frequencies (daily, hourly, minute data)?
- What happens when preprocessing fails for a specific asset or time period?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and handle missing values in time series data
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and process outliers using statistical methods
- **FR-003**: System MUST normalize or standardize data features to consistent scales
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate data integrity and flag suspicious values
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide configurable preprocessing rules for different asset types
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all preprocessing actions and data quality metrics
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle different data frequencies and align time series
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate data quality reports before and after preprocessing

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-009**: System MUST fill missing values using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: imputation method not specified - forward fill, interpolation, statistical models?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST detect outliers using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: outlier detection method not specified - Z-score, IQR, custom thresholds?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST normalize data using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: normalization technique not specified - min-max, z-score, robust scaling?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Raw Data Stream**: Ingested market data from various sources (price, volume, indicators)
- **Processed Data**: Cleaned and normalized output ready for analysis
- **Preprocessing Rules**: Configurable settings for handling data quality issues
- **Quality Metrics**: Statistics measuring data completeness, consistency, and validity
- **Processing Log**: Record of all transformations applied to the data
