# Tasks: Data Preprocessing System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-implement-preprocessing-of/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: tech stack (Python 3.11+, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), libraries, structure
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 5 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/preprocessing-api.yml: Extract 6 endpoints → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract preprocessing decisions → implementation tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract CLI scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, statistical validation, quality tests
   → Core: 3 libraries (cleaning, validation, normalization), CLI, quality metrics
   → Integration: configuration system, logging, performance monitoring
   → Polish: unit tests, performance validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All preprocessing methods implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD principle)
- Commit after each task for better tracking
- Focus on library-first architecture with clear mathematical purpose
- Ensure all preprocessing methods are statistically validated
- Include comprehensive error handling and logging
- Performance targets: Process 10M data points in <30 seconds, memory usage <4GB

## Task Generation Rules Applied

### 1. From API Contracts (preprocessing-api.yml):
   - 6 endpoints → 4 contract test files [P]
   - Each endpoint → API implementation task

### 2. From Data Model (data-model.md):
   - 5 entities → 5 model creation tasks [P]
   - Each entity → data quality validation test [P]

### 3. From Research (research.md):
   - 3 preprocessing categories → 3 core libraries [P]
   - Each preprocessing method → statistical validation test [P]
   - Quality metrics → quality assessment system

### 4. From Quickstart (quickstart.md):
   - CLI usage scenarios → integration test tasks [P]
   - Configuration examples → configuration system tasks

### 5. From Constitution Requirements:
   - Library-first architecture → 3 core mathematical libraries
   - Statistical validation → comprehensive test coverage
   - CLI interface → command-line tools
   - Reproducibility → configuration and versioning system
