# Implementation Plan: Data Preprocessing System

**Branch**: `001-implement-preprocessing-of` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-implement-preprocessing-of/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The data preprocessing system will implement comprehensive data cleaning, validation, and normalization capabilities for financial time series data. The system must handle missing values, outliers, and scale inconsistencies to ensure data quality before quantitative analysis.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
**Storage**: File-based (CSV, Parquet) + in-memory processing
**Testing**: pytest, hypothesis for statistical validation
**Target Platform**: Linux/Windows/macOS (CLI-based)
**Project Type**: single (library-first quantitative library)
**Performance Goals**: Process 10M data points in <30 seconds
**Constraints**: Memory usage <4GB for typical datasets, must handle NaN and infinity properly
**Scale/Scope**: Support 500+ instruments, 10+ years of daily data, multi-frequency support

**NEEDS CLARIFICATION from specification**:
- Missing value imputation method: forward fill, interpolation, or statistical models?
- Outlier detection method: Z-score, IQR, or custom thresholds?
- Normalization technique: min-max, z-score, or robust scaling?

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Library-First Architecture Gate (Article I)
- [x] Feature decomposed into ≤3 mathematical libraries? (data-cleaning, data-validation, data-normalization)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single project (library-first quantitative library)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API endpoint → contract test task [P]
- Each data entity → model implementation task [P]
- Each preprocessing method → implementation task
- Each quality metric → validation task
- CLI interface → integration test task
- Quickstart scenario → end-to-end test

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Core libraries → CLI → integration
- Library-first: Data preprocessing components before higher-level features
- Statistical validation: Quality metrics integration throughout
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Key Task Categories**:
1. **Core Libraries**: Data cleaning, validation, normalization (3 libraries)
2. **Configuration System**: JSON config management and validation
3. **CLI Interface**: Command-line preprocessing pipeline
4. **Quality Assessment**: Metrics calculation and reporting
5. **API Contracts**: RESTful API for preprocessing services
6. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, statistical validation
7. **Documentation**: Quickstart guide and API documentation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
