# Feature Specification: Generate Initial Financial Features

**Feature Branch**: `[002-generate-initial-features]`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Generate initial features returns, rolling volatility, momentum etc."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description: "Generate initial features returns, rolling volatility, momentum etc."
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: financial features (returns, volatility, momentum), quantitative analysis, time series processing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Quantitative researcher needs financial features for analysis
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (financial data, features, time series)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "optimization strategy" without risk constraints), mark it
3. **Think like a quant researcher**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas in quantitative finance**:
   - Mathematical formulations and model assumptions
   - Risk constraints and performance targets (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
   - Data requirements (frequency, history, universe coverage)
   - Backtesting methodology and validation approaches
   - Statistical significance thresholds and confidence levels
   - Portfolio construction constraints (concentration, leverage, turnover)
   - Benchmark definitions and performance attribution
   - Model governance and version control requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a quantitative researcher, I need to generate initial financial features including returns, rolling volatility, and momentum indicators from market data, so that I can analyze and model financial instruments for trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** historical price data for financial instruments, **When** I request feature generation, **Then** the system MUST calculate returns, rolling volatility, and momentum features for all specified instruments.
2. **Given** multiple financial instruments, **When** I process features, **Then** each instrument MUST have complete feature sets calculated consistently.
3. **Given** incomplete or missing price data, **When** I generate features, **Then** the system MUST handle gaps appropriately according to predefined rules.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there's insufficient historical data to calculate rolling windows?
- How does the system handle instruments with no price data on certain dates?
- What occurs during extreme market events that cause abnormal price movements?
- How are features calculated for instruments with different data frequencies?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST calculate price returns for financial instruments over specified periods
- **FR-002**: System MUST compute rolling volatility metrics using configurable window sizes
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate momentum indicators including [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific momentum types required? - simple momentum, relative strength, rate of change, etc.]
- **FR-004**: System MUST support multiple return calculation methods including [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which return types? - arithmetic, logarithmic, percentage, etc.]
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply consistent calculations across all financial instruments in the universe
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle missing data and outliers according to predefined quality rules
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow customization of calculation parameters (window sizes, lookback periods, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate output features for statistical validity and numerical stability
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide timestamps for all calculated features to maintain time series integrity
- **FR-010**: System MUST scale calculations efficiently for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected data volume? - thousands of instruments, daily frequency, etc.]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Financial Instrument**: Represents tradable assets (stocks, ETFs, etc.) with price history and metadata
- **Price Data**: Historical time series of prices (open, high, low, close, volume) for each instrument
- **Return Series**: Calculated price changes over specified periods for each instrument
- **Volatility Measure**: Statistical measure of price fluctuation calculated over rolling windows
- **Momentum Indicator**: Technical analysis measures capturing price movement trends and strength
- **Feature Set**: Collection of all calculated features for each instrument and time period
