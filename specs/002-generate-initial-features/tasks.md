# Tasks: Generate Initial Financial Features

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-generate-initial-features/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `data/src/`, `tests/` at repository root (following project structure from plan.md)

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create data/src/lib/ directory structure for feature libraries
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python project with financial dependencies (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Yahoo Finance API)
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting (flake8) and formatting (black) tools for financial code

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T004 [P] Returns calculation validation tests in tests/unit/test_returns_validation.py
- [ ] T005 [P] Volatility calculation statistical tests in tests/unit/test_volatility_validation.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Momentum indicator mathematical tests in tests/unit/test_momentum_validation.py
- [ ] T007 [P] Data quality and preprocessing tests in tests/unit/test_data_quality.py
- [ ] T008 [P] Feature integration contract tests in tests/contract/test_api_contract.py
- [ ] T009 [P] CLI interface contract tests in tests/contract/test_cli_contract.py

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T010 [P] FinancialInstrument data model in data/src/models/financial_instrument.py

- [ ] T014 [P] VolatilityMeasure calculation model in data/src/models/volatility_measure.py
- [ ] T015 [P] MomentumIndicator calculation model in data/src/models/momentum_indicator.py
- [ ] T016 [P] Returns calculation library in data/src/lib/returns.py (arithmetic, logarithmic, percentage)
- [ ] T017 [P] Volatility calculation library in data/src/lib/volatility.py (rolling standard deviation, annualized)
- [ ] T018 [P] Momentum indicators library in data/src/lib/momentum.py (simple momentum, RSI, ROC)
- [ ] T019 [P] Data validation service in data/src/services/validation_service.py
- [ ] T020 [P] Feature generation service in data/src/services/feature_service.py
- [ ] T021 [P] CLI commands for feature generation in data/src/cli/feature_commands.py

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T022 Connect CLI commands to feature generation service
- [ ] T023 Integrate validation service with data preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] T024 Implement mathematical formulations across all calculation libraries
- [ ] T025 Add structured logging for calculation decisions and quality metrics
- [ ] T026 Integrate with existing data preprocessing system (cleaning, validation, normalization)

## Phase 3.5: Polish & Validation
- [ ] T027 [P] Performance benchmarking tests (10M data points <30s, <4GB memory) in tests/performance/test_benchmarks.py
- [ ] T028 [P] Statistical significance tests for all calculated features in tests/statistical/test_feature_significance.py
- [ ] T029 [P] Update quickstart.md with actual implementation examples
- [ ] T030 Memory efficiency validation tests in tests/performance/test_memory_usage.py
- [ ] T031 Configuration management and reproducibility validation
- [ ] T032 Documentation of mathematical formulations in docs/financial_features.md
- [ ] T033 End-to-end integration tests following quickstart scenarios
