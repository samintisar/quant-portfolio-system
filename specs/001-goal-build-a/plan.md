# Trading Strategy Implementation Plan: Data Pipeline & Project Scaffolding

**Branch**: `001-goal-build-a` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [`specs/001-goal-build-a/spec.md`](specs/001-goal-build-a/spec.md)
**Input**: Trading strategy specification from `/specs/001-goal-build-a/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load trading strategy spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No trading strategy spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Trading Strategy Type from context (momentum, mean-reversion, arbitrage, etc.)
   → Set Structure Decision based on strategy type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify trading approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve trading unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor trading design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This implementation plan establishes a comprehensive data pipeline and project scaffolding for a quantitative trading system. The system will support multiple trading strategies (momentum, mean-reversion, portfolio optimization) with robust data ingestion, processing, risk management, and backtesting capabilities. The approach follows a library-first architecture with CLI interfaces and comprehensive testing framework.

## Technical Context

**Primary Dependencies**: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, yfinance, quandl, fredapi, backtrader, zipline, cvxopt, pypfopt, matplotlib, plotly, dash, pytest, black, flake8
**Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance API, Quandl, FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
**Backtesting**: Backtrader framework with custom performance metrics
**Risk Management**: Custom risk library with VaR, CVaR, Monte Carlo simulations
**Target Environment**: Linux/Windows development environment with potential cloud deployment
**Strategy Type**: Multi-strategy platform (momentum, mean-reversion, portfolio optimization)
**Performance Goals**: Sharpe ratio > 1.2, max drawdown < 10%, win rate > 55%, processing latency < 1ms per data point
**Latency Requirements**: <100ms signal generation, <10ms order execution in backtesting
**Data Requirements**: Daily OHLCV data with 1+ year history, support for multiple asset classes

**Structure Decision**: Multi-strategy platform (detected "portfolio" + "optimization" requirements)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Data pipeline architecture patterns and best practices
   - Multi-asset class data normalization strategies
   - Risk management implementation approaches
   - Portfolio optimization algorithm selection
   - Performance benchmarking standards

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For data pipeline architecture:
     Task: "Research best practices for quantitative trading data pipelines"
   For multi-asset class support:
     Task: "Validate data normalization approaches for equities, forex, commodities"
   For risk management:
     Task: "Research VaR/CVaR implementation approaches for portfolio risk"
   For portfolio optimization:
     Task: "Evaluate modern portfolio optimization techniques and libraries"
   For performance benchmarks:
     Task: "Establish industry performance standards for quantitative trading systems"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen with quantitative justification]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
   - Backtest results: [historical validation if available]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract trading entities from strategy spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Trading entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from trading requirements
   - State transitions for market regimes if applicable

2. **Generate trading strategy contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each trading signal → strategy interface
   - For each risk rule → risk management contract
   - For each data feed → data contract
   - Output trading schemas to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per trading strategy component
   - Assert trading signal generation and risk management
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract backtest scenarios** from trading stories:
   - Each trading scenario → backtest validation
   - Quickstart test = strategy validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW trading tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent trading changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each trading contract → trading contract test task [P]
- Each trading entity → trading model creation task [P]
- Each trading scenario → backtest integration task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Data models before strategies before execution
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Multi-library architecture | Required for separation of concerns in quantitative trading | Single monolithic library would violate constitution and create untestable components |
| Multi-strategy platform | Required to support different trading strategies and portfolio optimization | Single strategy approach would limit system flexibility and portfolio capabilities |
