# Trading Strategy Research: Data Pipeline & Project Scaffolding

## Strategy Analysis

### Current State Assessment
- **Problem Statement**: Quantitative trading system lacks foundational data infrastructure
- **Gap Analysis**: No unified data pipeline, inconsistent project structure, no testing framework
- **Scope**: Foundational infrastructure for multiple trading strategies

### Market Research Findings

#### Data Pipeline Best Practices in Quantitative Trading
1. **Data Sources Hierarchy**:
   - Primary: Yahoo Finance (free, reliable for equities/ETFs)
   - Secondary: Quandl (alternative data, economic indicators)
   - Macroeconomic: FRED (interest rates, inflation, GDP)
   - Institutional: Bloomberg Terminal (future enhancement)

2. **Data Processing Requirements**:
   - Real-time data ingestion capabilities
   - Historical data storage and retrieval
   - Data normalization across multiple sources
   - Missing data handling and outlier detection
   - Feature engineering for predictive modeling

3. **Asset Class Considerations**:
   - **Equities**: NYSE, NASDAQ (high liquidity, good data availability)
   - **Forex**: Major currency pairs (24/5 trading, high volatility)
   - **Commodities**: Gold, Oil (inflation hedge, geopolitical sensitivity)
   - **ETFs**: Sector rotation, diversification benefits

#### Trading Strategy Types Supported
1. **Momentum Strategies**:
   - Moving average crossovers
   - Relative strength indicators
   - Breakout patterns
   - Trend following

2. **Mean Reversion Strategies**:
   - Pairs trading
   - Statistical arbitrage
   - Bollinger Band strategies
   - RSI-based reversals

3. **Portfolio Optimization**:
   - Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
   - Risk parity approaches
   - Factor-based investing
   - Black-Litterman model

### Technical Research

#### Data Pipeline Architecture Patterns
1. **Lambda Architecture**:
   - Batch processing for historical analysis
   - Stream processing for real-time signals
   - Serving layer for backtesting and live trading

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Data arrival triggers processing
   - Modular component design
   - Fault tolerance and recovery

#### Configuration Management
1. **Environment-Specific Configs**:
   - Development (local testing)
   - Staging (validation)
   - Production (live trading)

2. **Parameter Management**:
   - Strategy parameters (timeframes, thresholds)
   - Risk parameters (position limits, stop losses)
   - Data source configurations (API keys, update frequencies)

### Risk Analysis

#### Data Quality Risks
1. **Missing Data**: Trading gaps, corporate actions, holidays
2. **Data Corruption**: API errors, transmission issues
3. **Latency Issues**: Real-time vs delayed data feeds
