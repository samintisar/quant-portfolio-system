# Trading Strategy Specification: Data Pipeline & Project Scaffolding

**Feature Branch**: `001-goal-build-a`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Goal: Build a solid data pipeline and establish project scaffolding. " Set up repo structure, configs, and testing framework.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse trading strategy description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No strategy description provided"
2. Extract key trading concepts from description
   ’ Identify: assets, timeframes, indicators, risk rules
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill Trading Scenarios & Backtesting section
   ’ If no clear trading logic: ERROR "Cannot determine trading scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable via backtesting
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Trading Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Strategy has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (strategy ready for implementation planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT trading strategy does and WHY it should generate alpha
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no algorithms, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for quantitative analysts, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every trading strategy
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the strategy
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this strategy spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "momentum strategy" without timeframe), mark it
3. **Think like a quant**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Asset classes and instruments
   - Timeframes and holding periods
   - Risk parameters and position sizing
   - Entry/exit criteria
   - Market regime considerations
   - Performance benchmarks and targets

## Trading Scenarios & Backtesting *(mandatory)*

### Primary Trading Strategy
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: This is a data pipeline project, not a trading strategy. Please specify which trading strategies will use this pipeline, e.g., "The data pipeline will support multiple trading strategies including momentum, mean-reversion, and statistical arbitrage across equity and forex markets"]

### Market Regime Analysis
1. **Bull Market**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How will the data pipeline identify and handle bull market conditions?]
2. **Bear Market**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How will the data pipeline identify and handle bear market conditions?]
3. **Sideways Market**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How will the data pipeline identify and handle sideways markets?]
4. **High Volatility**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How will the data pipeline identify and handle high volatility periods?]

### Backtest Scenarios
- **Given** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What market conditions?], **When** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What signals?], **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What trade actions?]
- **Given** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What market conditions?], **When** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What risk limits?], **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What risk responses?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Data pipeline MUST ingest historical market data from [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which data sources? Yahoo Finance, Quandl, FRED, etc.?]
- **FR-002**: System MUST store and manage [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What type of data? Price data, fundamental data, alternative data?]
- **FR-003**: Data pipeline MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What data processing? Normalization, feature engineering, cleaning?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What data quality requirements? Accuracy, completeness, timeliness?]
- **FR-005**: Pipeline MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What asset classes? Equities, forex, commodities, crypto?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What testing framework capabilities? Unit tests, integration tests, backtesting validation?]
- **FR-007**: Configuration system MUST manage [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What configurations? Data sources, strategy parameters, risk settings?]
- **FR-008**: Project structure MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What organizational needs? Modularity, scalability, maintainability?]

### Key Trading Entities *(include if strategy involves data)*
- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What trading entities?]**: [What they represent, key attributes without implementation]
- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What data entities?]**: [What they represent, relationships to other entities]

### Risk Parameters *(mandatory for trading strategies)*
- **Maximum Position Size**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What position sizing limits?]
- **Stop Loss**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What stop loss methodology?]
- **Take Profit**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What take profit strategy?]
- **Maximum Drawdown**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What drawdown limits?]
