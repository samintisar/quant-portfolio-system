## Anti-Overengineering Guidelines

### Keep It Simple
- **Focus on 15-20 large cap US stocks** (not hundreds)
- **Use Yahoo Finance API** (not expensive data providers)
- **Single time frame** (daily data, 3-5 years)
- **Standard ML models** (Random Forest, XGBoost - no deep learning)

### Production Minimums
- **Basic FastAPI endpoints** (no complex microservices)
- **Simple Streamlit dashboard** (no complex frontend)
- **Docker container** (no Kubernetes)
- **Free cloud tier** (no expensive infrastructure)

### Documentation Priorities
- **Clean README** with setup instructions
- **API documentation** (auto-generated from FastAPI)
- **Jupyter notebook examples** (not extensive docs)
- **Code comments** for key mathematical concepts
