# PRD: Quant Portfolio Optimization System with ML Enhancements

## 1. Overview
This project showcases modern quantitative finance and machine learning in a production-ready application. It implements core portfolio optimization methods (Mean-Variance, Black-Litterman, CVaR) and augments them with ML-driven return predictions and risk estimation. The system balances theory with real-world constraints, providing a strong resume project that demonstrates full-stack ML engineering and quantitative modeling.
