# PRD: Quantitative Trading & Portfolio Optimization System

## 1. Overview

The Quantitative Trading & Portfolio Optimization System is an end-to-end platform designed to research, test, and implement systematic investment strategies across multiple asset classes. The system ingests historical financial data, applies advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to model returns and volatility, and optimizes portfolio allocation under risk and regulatory constraints. It integrates forecasting, risk management, and backtesting into one cohesive workflow.

This project demonstrates the ability to design, implement, and scale quant-driven investment tools, directly aligning with institutional asset management needs.

## 2. Objectives

- **Strategy Development**: Research and implement predictive models for asset returns and volatility
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Allocate assets optimally under constraints (risk limits, sector weights, transaction costs)
- **Risk Management**: Integrate risk measures (VaR, CVaR, drawdown) to ensure robustness across market regimes
- **Backtesting Framework**: Enable performance evaluation using historical and out-of-sample testing
- **Automation & Intelligence**: Use AI-inspired methods (belief networks, Markov models, heuristic search, constraint satisfaction, planning)

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Data Ingestion & Processing
- Pull historical market data (daily data for 500+ stocks, ETFs, FX, bonds over 10+ years)
- Apply feature engineering (rolling averages, volatility clusters, factor exposures)
- Handle missing values and normalization pipelines

### 3.2 Predictive Modeling
- **Belief Networks**: For probabilistic market event modeling
- **Markov Models**: Regime-switching (bull vs. bear markets)
- **ARIMA/GARCH**: Time series forecasting for returns and volatility
- **Machine Learning Models**: Gradient boosting, neural nets for signal generation

### 3.3 Portfolio Optimization
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Enforce sector neutral, long-only, max 5% single name concentration, turnover, and leverage constraints
- **Planning**: Dynamic rebalancing of portfolio under changing forecasts
- **Optimization Techniques**: Mean-variance optimization, Black-Litterman, robust optimization

### 3.4 Risk Management
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR)**, Conditional VaR (CVaR)
- **Monte Carlo** scenario simulations
- **Stress testing** with macroeconomic shocks

### 3.5 Backtesting & Evaluation
- **Walk-forward validation**
- **Transaction cost modeling**
- **Metrics**: Sharpe, Sortino, Information ratio, max drawdown

## 4. System Architecture

- **Data Layer**: Historical & live market data ingestion (Yahoo Finance)
- **Model Layer**: Predictive models (Markov, belief networks, ML)
- **Optimization Layer**: Portfolio allocation under constraints
- **Execution Layer**: Backtesting engine simulating trades
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualization of portfolio performance and risk metrics
